<h1>Raspberry Pi Pico RC Car Project </h1>

<s><p>This repository contains all the details and resources for a cutting-edge, custom-built Raspberry Pi Pico-based RC Car. This project symbolizes my fervor for constructing hardware and architecting intelligent software.</p></s>
<p>
Currently, this repository is a playground for me to get accustomed to FreeRTOS, cmake and general project setup. But in the close future I'll have the RC car running!

<h2>Essential Components</h2>

<p>The triumphant execution of this project depends on a blend of dependable hardware and potent software:</p>

<h3>Ô∏èHardware (Tentative Plan)</h3>
<p>Hardware may change as my understanding advances.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong>: tiny, fast, and versatile boards built using RP2040, the flagship microcontroller chip designed by Raspberry Pi in the UK</li>
    <li><strong>L298N</strong>: The motor driver, a significant component for driving the car's motor.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Software</h3>

<p>We're harnessing the power of advanced software tools for this RC car:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>FreeRTOS</strong>: This open-source real-time operating system for embedded devices ensures efficiency and rapid responsiveness.</li>
  <li><strong>Raspberry Pi Pico-SDK</strong>: Crucial for regulating Pulse Width Modulation, which effectively controls the speed of the car.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project showcases my adeptness in both hardware and software engineering. It exemplifies a comprehensive understanding of microcontroller systems, motor control, real-time operating systems, and the Arduino programming environment. I'm excited to share this project and am open for any further discussions or elucidations required.</p>
